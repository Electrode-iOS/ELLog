# Shrubbery
Let's not beat around the bush, we need a logging solution but we don't want to write our own, so put Cocoa Lumberjack behind the fence of a good shrubbery

# Installing with modulo

Shrubbery comes set up to be used with modulo (https://github.com/setdirection/modulo). Modulo will pull down Cocoa Lumberjacks for you and install it. If your parent project uses modulo, then there is no chance that Cocoa Lumberjack will be installed twice.
